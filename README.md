# ‚òï Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard  

## üìñ Project Overview  
Imagine you‚Äôre running a busy coffee shop chain. You want to know:  
- Which products sell the most?  
- Which days and hours are busiest?  
- How sales are growing (or declining) month by month?  

This project analyzes coffee shop sales data from **January to June 2023** using **Power BI**.  
The goal was to turn raw transaction data into a clear, interactive dashboard that reveals **business performance trends** at a glance.  

By combining **KPIs, Month-over-Month (MoM) growth, tooltips, and heatmaps**, the dashboard not only tracks sales but also tells a story of customer behavior and shop performance over time.

## üéØ Objective  
The main objective was to **design an interactive dashboard** that helps decision-makers:  
1. Track **Total Sales, Total Orders, and Total Quantity Sold**.  
2. Monitor **growth trends month-over-month (MoM)**.  
3. Discover **peak business hours and days** through a sales heatmap.  
4. Break down performance by **product categories, product types, and locations**.

## üìä Key Dashboard Features  

### **1. KPI Cards**  
- Show **Total Sales, Total Orders, and Total Quantity Sold**.  
- Built using **DAX measures** for accurate aggregation.  

### **2. Month-over-Month Growth Analysis**  
- DAX formulas calculate changes between months.  
- Indicators:  
  - ‚ñ≤ Positive growth  
  - ‚ñº Negative growth  
  - ‚ÄúNo Previous Month‚Äù (for January baseline).  

üëâ **Insight**: February saw a decline in all KPIs, but sales rebounded from March onward.  

### **3. Interactive Tooltips**  
- **Calendar View Tooltip** ‚Üí Hovering on a day highlights its sales contribution.  
- **Sales by Day & Hour Tooltip** ‚Üí Quickly reveals peak hours without switching charts.  
- This keeps the main dashboard clean while allowing deeper exploration.  

### **4. Sales Heatmap**  
- Visualizes sales intensity by **day of the week** and **hour of the day**.  
- Helps identify peak customer traffic (e.g., morning rush or weekend spikes).  

### **5. Breakdown Filters**  
- **Product Category** ‚Üí Coffee, Tea, Bakery, etc.  
- **Product Type** ‚Üí Subcategories within each product line.  
- **Location** ‚Üí Compare sales across different stores.

## üîë Key Insights  

- **February 2023**: Decline in MoM growth across all KPIs ‚Üí a potential business challenge.  
- **March to June 2023**: Steady recovery and consistent upward momentum.  
- **June 2023**: Peak performance month with the highest **sales, orders, and quantity sold**.  

This pattern highlights the importance of **seasonality** and tracking **early warning signals** (like February‚Äôs dip).
